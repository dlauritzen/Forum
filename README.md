Symfony/Bootstrap Webforum
==========================

Introduction
------------

This project is a PHP forum driven by the [Symfony][] framework, using
[Bootstrap][] to handle the layout and special effects. I'm writing it
for my Internet Programming class (CS 360) at Brigham Young University.

Future Plans
------------

I wrote a forum many years ago when I was first figuring out how to work a
computer. That site somehow escaped me and I cannot find it anywhere. Now, since
I have enrolled in many programming classes during my college experience, I am
excited to create a *new* forum that could possibly stand up to modern scrutiny.

I expect this forum to remain a tiny thing on my own website, but since I'm using
Github to manage the source, I release this code under the
