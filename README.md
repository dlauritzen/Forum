Symfony/Bootstrap Webforum
==========================

Introduction
------------

This project is a PHP forum driven by the [Symfony][] framework, using
[Bootstrap][] to handle the layout and special effects. I'm writing it
for my Internet Programming class (CS 360) at Brigham Young University.

Future Plans
------------

I wrote a forum many years ago when I was first figuring out how to work a
computer. That site somehow escaped me and I cannot find it anywhere. Now, since
I have enrolled in many programming classes during my college experience, I am
excited to create a *new* forum that could possibly stand up to modern scrutiny.

I expect this forum to remain a tiny thing on my own website, but since I'm using
Github to manage the source, I release this code under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License. Go ahead and take this code and use it or change it for your own website. Just give me credit for the parts you take and let me know about your website so I can see how you like it.
